#Quick Sort
Quick sort works by taking a pivot point and recursively sorting from a continuous pivot. Taking a pivot from the start it will then iterate on all items and place any items lower than the pivot into a bucket, and any items higher into another bucket. Both buckets run through the same cycle recursively, selecting a new pivot and dividing and conquering.

The recursion bubbles back to the top and merges the arrays so that the final result is the sorted array. This is very dependent on how the pivot is selected and it's value, its worst case is *n squared* however its divide and conquer is almost *nlogn*

##Pseudocode
```java
quickSort (array)

	if array.length <= 1
		return array
	
	pivot = array[0]
	left = []
	right = []
	for i=1 in array.length // start right to the pivot
		if array[i] < pivot
			left[] = array[i]
		else
			right[] = array[i]
	
	left = quickSort(left)
	right = quickSort(right)
	
	return merge of left + pivot + right
```

##PHP
```php
function quickSort($array) {

	if (count($array) <= 1) {
		return $array;
	}

	$pivot = array_shift($array);
	$left = [];
	$right = [];

	for ($i=0; $i < count($array); $i++) {
		if ($array[$i] < $pivot) {
			$left[] = $array[$i];
		} else {
			$right[] = $array[$i];
		}
	}

	$leftSorted = quickSort($left);
	$rightSorted = quickSort($right);

	$result = array_merge($leftSorted, [$pivot], $rightSorted);
	return $result;
}
```
