#Breadth First Search
Breadth first search is where a tree is traversed horizontally first then as all nodes on a level are discovered the tree will jump down one level. Breadth first search uses **Queues** to add elements on that have been discovered to come back to at a later stage. Like depth first search, breadth first search uses a set to maintain what notes have been discovered.

##Pseudocode
```java
Make empty queue
Make empty discovered set

while the queue has something
	take the first element off the queue
	add all children of the element to the end of the queue
	if the element is discovered then continue
	add node to the discovered set
```

##PHP
```php
function breadthFirst($rootNode) {

	$queue[] = $rootNode;

	while (count($queue) > 0) {
		$node = array_shift($queue);
		if (!in_array($node->left, $discovered) && $node->left != null) {
			$queue[] = $node->left;
		}
		if (!in_array($node->right, $discovered) && $node->right != null) {
			$queue[] = $node->right;
		}
	}

}
```
