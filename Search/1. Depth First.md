#Depth first search
Depth first search aims to go left to right but going straight to the base level of each branch as far as it can go then working left to right back up the tree.

In order to alleviate any chance of an infinite loop we need to keep track of which nodes have been traversed so that we do not traverse down again. 

##Pseudocode
```java
stack[] = rootNode
discoveredItems = []

while stack.length > 0
	node = pop first item off stack
	if the node hasn't been seen before
		stack[] = node
		
		for each node children
			stack[] = child
```

##PHP
```php
function depthFirst($rootNode) {

	$stack[] = $rootNode;
	$discovered = [];

	while(count($stack) > 0) {
		$node = array_shift($stack);

		if (in_array($node, $discovered)) {
			continue;
		}

		$discovered[] = $node;
		
		if (!in_array($node->left, $discovered)) {
			$stack[] = $node->left;
		}
		if (!in_array($node->right, $discovered)) {
			$stack[] = $node->right;
		}
	}

}
```
