#Depth first search
Depth first search aims to go left to right but going straight to the base level of each branch as far as it can go then working left to right back up the tree.

In order to alleviate any chance of an infinite loop we need to keep track of which nodes have been traversed so that we do not traverse down again. 

##Notes
There are three types of DFS types:

* Pre-order (echo out as you go down left, then up, right down on right, then up)
* In-order (go down left, echo as you come up, then go down right, echo as you come up)
* Post-order (go down left, go down right, echo as you come up)

##Usage
Can be used for:

* Finding longest path

##Pseudocode
```java
stack[] = rootNode

while stack.length > 0
	node = pop first item off stack
	for each node children
		stack[] = child
```

##PHP
```php
function depthFirst($rootNode) {

	$stack[] = $rootNode;
	while(count($stack) > 0) {
		$node = array_pop($stack);
		
		if ($node->left != null) {
		  array_push($stack, $node->left);
		}

		if ($node->right != null) {
		  array_push($stack, $node->right);
		}
		
	}

}
```
